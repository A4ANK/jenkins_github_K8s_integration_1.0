# Integration of Kubernetes with jenkins and Github
## to create resources like Pods, ReplicaSet, Deployment, PVC and Service, etc on the top of K8s.

1. Create container image thatâ€™s has Jenkins installed  using Dockerfile  Or You can use the Jenkins Server on RHEL 8/7
2. When we launch this image, it should automatically starts Jenkins service in the container.
3. Create a job chain of job1, job2, job3 and  job4 using build pipeline plugin in Jenkins 
4. Job1 : Pull  the Github repo automatically when some developers push repo to Github.
5. Job2 : 
   i. By looking at the code or program file, Jenkins should automatically start the respective language interpreter installed image container to deploy code on top of Kubernetes ( eg. If code is of  PHP, then Jenkins should start the container that has PHP already installed )
   ii.  Expose your pod so that testing team could perform the testing on the pod
   iii. Make the data to remain persistent ( If server collects some data like logs, other user information )
6. Job3 : Test your app if it  is working or not.
7. Job4 : if app is not working , then send email to developer with error messages and redeploy the application after code is being edited by the developer
